    followed the path of virtue. I will love truth and seek 
    wisdom, act with justice, fairness, and kindness, 
    master my fears and be courageous, and buffet my 
    desires with self-discipline. I will do these things by 
    never giving assent to a false or doubtful impression, by 
    directing my impulses only to actions that benefit the 
    common good, and by limiting my desires only to things that 
    are within my power while welcoming all that is assigned to 
    me by the universe.`}
